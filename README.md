# Spring 2022 ECE471 Duck Hunt Project

### Update
- duck_hunt_main.py and solution.py are my old solution (Third Approach)

### Note to Amanda or Declan:
- Please use the duck_hunt_main_mp.py and solution_mp.py for testing
- everything else keeps as default
- This program is based on Moving Objects Detection

### VERY IMPORTANT
If you see the gun is frozen at the beginning of game. Please restart the virtual environment.

This program should start and keep printing many numbers when you execute it. (not all 0)

In general, the accuracy of my program should at least 90% in most case (usually above 95%). 
In rain and changing shadows cases, the accuracy may lower, but still should higher than 80%.
You should not get results below 50%.

### Thank you for providing us such fun project !!
